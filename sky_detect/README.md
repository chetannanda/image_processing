# Sky detection

This implementation contains two algorithm for detecting sky in digital images.

1. Basic implementation based on color
2. Partial implementation based on paper "Sky Region Detection in a Single Image for Autonomous Ground Robot Navigation"

## Basic color based implementation

## Based on paper
